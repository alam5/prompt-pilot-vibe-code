# LinkedIn AI Comment Assistant Chrome Extension PRD

## Product Overview
A Chrome extension that enhances LinkedIn post interaction by providing AI-powered comment suggestions. The extension adds a button next to each LinkedIn post that, when clicked, captures the post content and sends it to an API for processing, then automatically populates the comment box with the response.

## Core Features

### 1. Post Button Integration
- Add an "AI Comment" button next to each LinkedIn post
- Button should be visually consistent with LinkedIn's UI design
- Button should appear dynamically as users scroll through their feed
- Button position should be consistent across different post types (text, images, articles)

### 2. Post Content Extraction
- Capture the full text content of the LinkedIn post when the button is clicked
- Handle different post formats (text-only, with images, shared posts)
- Extract only the relevant text content, excluding UI elements and metadata
- Support for handling expanded/collapsed post states

### 3. API Integration
- Make API calls to the specified endpoint
- Handle API request/response lifecycle
- Implement proper error handling for failed requests
- Support for request throttling to prevent API abuse

### 4. Response Handling
- Automatically copy API response to user's clipboard
- Insert the response into the LinkedIn post's comment box
- Handle response formatting to match LinkedIn's comment format
- Provide visual feedback during API processing

## Technical Requirements

### Chrome Extension Structure
- Manifest Version: 3
- Background Service Worker for API communication
- Content Script for DOM manipulation
- Popup interface for extension settings (if needed)

### Security Requirements
- Secure API key storage and management
- CORS handling for API requests
- Data sanitization for post content
- No storage of user post data

### Performance Requirements
- Button injection should not impact page load time
- API requests should timeout after 30 seconds
- Minimal impact on LinkedIn's native functionality
- Efficient DOM manipulation for button injection

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API failures
- User feedback for connection issues
- Fallback behavior when content extraction fails
- Clear error messages for users

## User Interface

### Button Design
- Clear, recognizable AI-themed icon
- Hover state with tooltip
- Loading state during API processing
- Success/failure state indicators
